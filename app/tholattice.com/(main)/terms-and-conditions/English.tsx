        <br />
        <p>
          In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or
          relating to these Terms or your use of Tholattice Digital
          Marketing&apos;s services, we encourage you to seek a prompt and
          amicable resolution through negotiation and informal discussions. Both
          parties agree to engage in good-faith negotiations to resolve the
          dispute.

        <h3>8.2 Mediation or Arbitration</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          If a dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation or informal
          discussions, the parties agree to consider alternative dispute
          resolution (ADR) methods, such as mediation or arbitration, before
          pursuing litigation. Mediation and arbitration are less formal and
          more cost-effective methods for resolving disputes.

          <li>
            <b>Mediation</b>: In the event of mediation, both parties agree to
            appoint a neutral third party, a mediator, who will facilitate
            discussions and negotiations to help the parties reach a mutually
            acceptable resolution.

          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Arbitration</b>: In the event of arbitration, both parties agree
            to appoint a neutral third party, an arbitrator, who will review the
            evidence and arguments presented by both parties and render a
            decision, which may be legally binding.

        <h3>8.3 Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          If informal negotiation, mediation, or arbitration does not resolve
          the dispute, both parties agree that any legal action or proceeding
          related to these Terms or your use of Tholattice Digital
          Marketing&apos;s services shall be governed by and construed in
          accordance with the laws of the state of California. The parties
          further agree that any legal action or proceeding shall be subject to
          the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the state of California.

        <h3>8.4 Small Claims Court</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the dispute resolution methods outlined above, either
          party may choose to bring an individual action in a small claims
          court, provided that such action is within the court&apos;s
          jurisdiction.

        <h3>8.5 Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          You and Tholattice Digital Marketing agree that any claims,
          controversies, or disputes must be brought in the parties&apos;
          individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
          purported class, collective, or representative proceeding.

          Each party shall bear its own costs and legal fees associated with any
          dispute resolution method unless otherwise required by law.
